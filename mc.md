# Mini Challenge 5

Further permissions and management support.

## Criteria
1. Team members can only see and interact with data generated by their team (members).
2. Add support for a new "manager" role who can see:
2.1. A "report" page where the issues that all team members (across all teams) are reported.
2.2. Bonus: add a tally next to each user representing how many issues they've completed.
3. All form-based views redirect to the list view (issue list view)
## Note
Consider using the built-in python module `datetime` to generate timestamps.

### Example
```
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime.now()
